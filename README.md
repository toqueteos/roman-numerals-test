## Requirements

- Prettier (optional)

## How to run this

```bash
$ node index.js
```

This will run the test runner with all test cases specified in the document.

## Remarks

I did work on the tests for about 1 hour and didn't follow the commit every 10 minutes rule for the last 7 commits.

I had all the work done but didn't want to commit all of that in a single commit.
